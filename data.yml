  Code Park opens fun coding experiences to students in the Houston area.


  In our classes, students focus on fundamental coding skills and work
  on real world projects. They get the hands-on experience they need
  to continue their own journeys as coders.

  - title: 3D Animations/VR
    description: >
      In this series, students will be introduced to building 3D scenes and
      animating them.  By the end, they will have a version of the following
      scene:

      <small>Scene and code will be adapted from this
      [online tutorial](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2016/04/26/the-aviator-animating-basic-3d-scene-threejs/).</small>

    objectives:
      - name: 3D spatial reasoning
      - name: Lighting and cameras in 3D scenes
      - name: Principles of animation
      - name: Coding in JavaScript
      - name: Object-oriented programming

    sessions:
      - title: What are we making?
        description: >
          In this class, we will demonstrate the scene we will be building
          together on the computer.  We are also going to have simple cut-out
          and fold paper activity to recreate the scene in real life as teams
          to demonstrate the idea of following directions to build a scene.
          We will discuss what was easy or difficult about the activity.


          We will also have a discussion with the students about any
          animated 3D movies or videos they may have seen to relate
          how the scenes may be constructed to the principles
          we will cover.

      - title: Shapes on a scene
        description: >
          This class will cover how we will be working together throughout
          the rest of our classes, how we will be coding our project, and
          how we can share our projects.


          Students will learn vocabulary such as `scene` and `mesh`.  We will
          end the class having changed the scene's background, placed a mesh
          on the scene, and view the scene on our phones.

      - title: A shapes factory
        description: >
          This class will focus on making the clouds in the scene out of multiple
          other shapes, and we can tell the computer to quickly make many different
          clouds.  We will point out how once we had instructions for the computer to
          follow about making clouds, we could use "Object-oriented" code to make
          many clouds easily, something that was more tedious when we were making the
          scene by hand.

      - title: Lights, camera, action
        description: >
          In this class, we will make the sea together, add lighting, and a camera.
          We will experiment with the lighting to show how it affects the scene, and look
          at scenes from 3D animated movies to discuss how they make us feel, and how that
          is being acheived.

      - title: More complex shapes
        description: >
          We will build a plane made of several shapes and use the visual inspector to
          help us edit the plane.

      - title: Animation
        description: >
          In this class, we will animate the sky, sea, and plane.  We will introduce the
          concept of animation using sketches and a flip book, demonstrate updating an
          animation one frame at time, and finally letting the animation run automatically. 

          We will have a discussion about animations in movies and how different objects
          and characters appear life-like.

      - title: Wrap up and demonstrations
        description: >
          This is the last class of this series!  We will work a little more on our
          animations to experiment, share them, and have a guest animator come share
          their experience as a professional.

      - title: Hands-on "data sculpture"
        description: >
          Shared data set with hands-on materials for students
          to collaborate in groups on.  As a class, walk to each
          visualization and have students share.

          A discussion about what data visualization is,
          where students might've seen examples of it
          through their life. When might they use data visualization?

          Also, facilitate a poll/survey -- physical and fun if possible
          as a way to collect data for the next class.

      - title: What will we be making?
        description: >
          A demonstration of different resulting projects, and looking
          at existing data visualizations and discussing/critiquing in
          groups.
